# Introduction

Good morning everyone!

*Akshit Gaur* here!

### A bit about myself

I am Akshit Gaur, an Undergraduate student currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi (yes, it does offer Engineering courses).

I am alright in academics and a failure in sports but where I truly shine is in front of a computer. I have been using linux since I was in class 8  and have successfully converted many-a-people to this religion.
