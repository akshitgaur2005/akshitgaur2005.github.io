# Déjà vu?

The three people that may have read a previous iteration of this blog on the previous iteration of this website, that I accidentaly nuked while changing the framework from hugo to astro, are requested to pretend this is some fresh piece of writing.

Yes, I am THAT stupid

Regardless, if you want to hear me ramble more about a topic I don't fully understand, continue on!!


# What is Guix?

In its own [words](https://guix.gnu.org/en/about/),

> The GNU Guix package and system manager is a free software project developed by volunteers around the world under the umbrella of the GNU Project. 

> Guix System is a distribution of the GNU operating system. It uses the Linux-libre kernel, and support for the Hurd is being worked on. As a GNU distribution, it is committed to respecting and enhancing the freedom of its users. As such, it adheres to the GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines.

> GNU Guix provides state-of-the-art package management features such as transactional upgrades and roll-backs, reproducible build environments, unprivileged package management, and per-user profiles. It uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, but packages are defined as native Guile modules, using extensions to the Scheme language—which makes it nicely hackable.

> Guix takes that a step further by additionally supporting stateless, reproducible operating system configurations. This time the whole system is hackable in Scheme, from the initial RAM disk to the initialization system, and to the system services.

Guix is a distro intended for geeks, incidentally pronounced that way too. There is no way to sugarcoat it, there is an inherent difficulty to these things, if you find Arch difficult to use, you shouldn't use Nix, if you can't use Nix, you should probably stay away from Guix, and if you can master Guix&#x2026; you still won't be able to use Windows without borking it!


## Story Time

I have been on linux since I was 13 (2018) and in my 7 years of using it, it has been exactly 3 times when I was hugely excited about linux itself, not some tooling related to it or any work I did using it, linux itself.


### The Beginnings

First was when I discovered Linux, in the form of Ubuntu which at that time had not gone down the drain. My laptop was a brand-new Dell laptop with i3 6th gen CPU, 4 gigabytes of RAM and a whopping 1 TB of Hard Disk capacity, I had worked with PC's before this (I learned how to play *Surma Sarela* and *Bhalu Lagdu Bhanuli* on my father's computer when I was 3) but it had been mostly superficial with only a little dabbling in the Front-End development space due to the encouragement from my *Chachu* (Uncle). But I digress, as you would expect this did not lead to me being an expert in all things computer and I borked that laptop many times on Windows. Eventually I read a little about Ubuntu on the internet and figured well why not?! What do I have to lose! The process was not very difficult and I managed to install it. Suprisingly, the transition was very smooth (it speaks to its quality that even a 13 year old ME was able to install and use it) and I would wait for every update, and this would lead to me becoming addicted to this excitement, becoming the ill-fated **Distro-Hopper**.


### Mid-Life Crisis

When 2020 with its Covid Craziness<sup>TM</sup> hit, I found myself with a lot of free time on my hand
